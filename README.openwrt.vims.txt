## Install

just write image to SD card

### Linux - default installation method examples

    wget http://SERVER/IMAGE.sd.zip
    unzip -p IMAGE.sd.zip '*.img' | sudo dd bs=1M of=/dev/YOUR_SD_CARD

    wget http://SERVER/IMAGE.sd.img.gz
    gzip -dc IMAGE.sd.img.gz | sudo dd bs=1M of=/dev/YOUR_SD_CARD

    wget http://dl.khadas.com/Firmware/VIM1/OpenWrt/IMAGE.sd.img.gz -O- | gzip -dc | sudo dd bs=1M of=/dev/YOUR_SD_CARD

NOTE: Remember to replace the words **IMAGE** and **YOUR_SD_CARD**, to the correct values in your system.

### Another OS (or if previous methods were difficult for you) /  Linux - GUI

Use [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to burn the OpenWrt image to your SD card or USB f.

    sudo ./balenaEtcher-1.5.57-x64.AppImage

Just select the IMAGE.img.gz or IMAGE.img.zip image, and select your SD card as the target. Press burn!
( There is no need to decompress the image )

## BOOT from SD card

+ Best way is to just boot openwrt from your SD card.
+ If your EMMC is empty, openwrt will automatically boot from your SD card.
+ Else, Uboot will start from EMMC by default - it can boot from SD card, but only with the proper version and config!

### VIM1 v12 (old) VIM2 v12 old

* Power on VIM1.
* Short-circuit the two pads of the M register (back PCB side), and without releasing itâ€¦ https://docs.khadas.com/images/vim1/MRegister_ShortCircuit.png
* Short press the Reset key, then release it to force boot from SD card
https://docs.khadas.com/vim1/HowtoBootIntoUpgradeMode.html#MRegister-Mode-Maskrom-Mode

### VIM1 v14 (current) VIM2 v14 (current)

Just triple-press `KEY_F` (middle button) to force SD bootup!

## INSTALL to EMMC (internal storage)

* Write image to SD card.
* Open/mount SD card (OW_BOOT partition) on your PC.
* Activate this script `scripts/install2mmc_from_sd.script` which is stored in the first partition. Rename it from `install2mmc_from_sd.script.disabled` -> `install2mmc_from_sd.script`.
* Unmount/eject SD card from your PC .
* Insert SD card into VIM1 (TF card slot).
* Power on + force boot from SD card by triple pressing `KEY_F` (middle button).
* Wait for the "remove SD card" message to appear, before ejecting your SD card.
* OK! Well done! EMMC boot will occur automatically.

NOTE: All previous EMMC data will be lost!!!
